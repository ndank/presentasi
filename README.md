Jump-start your next presentation using a GitPitch markdown
presentation template.

Each branch in this repo contains a self-contained, GitPitch
markdown presentation template. Out-of-the-box each template
gives you:

- A distinctive theme
- Attractive typeface and imagery
- Sample [custom CSS](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Slideshow-Custom-CSS)
- Sample [custom Settings](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Slideshow-Settings)
- And sample markdown that demonstrates a wide range of [GitPitch features](https://gitpitch.com/features.html).

While you focus on your content, presentation templates
ensure your content is delivered as beautifully rendered, fully
responsive, online and offline slideshow presentations.

## Presentation Template Images

All images used within these templates were gifted by the worldâ€™s
most generous community of photographers, see [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

This free collection of beautiful images is a great resource for any
GitPitch presentation author. Please remember to minimize your image
assets before adding them to your Git repo. The highest quality,
free image optimization service I have found online is [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). 

These are just personal recommendations, I have no affiliation with 
either service.
